# newSIR.herd-immunity.model.script
The file contains the scripts to simulate the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases in conventional SIR model and new SIR models with regards to natural immunity and vaccine-induced immunity. The new SIR models overcome the limitation of the conventional SIR model in simulating the impact of herd immunity in the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases.
